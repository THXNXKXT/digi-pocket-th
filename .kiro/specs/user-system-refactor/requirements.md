# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring and enhancing the user management system in the Digi-Pocket application. The current user system needs to be modernized with better security, user experience features, and administrative capabilities. The refactored system will provide comprehensive user management including authentication, authorization, profile management, activity tracking, and administrative controls.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL send an email verification token
3. WHEN a user verifies their email THEN the system SHALL activate their account
4. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL support both email/username and password authentication
5. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate secure JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
6. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset token via email
7. WHEN a user resets password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions
8. IF a user enters wrong credentials 5 times THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile and preferences, so that I can personalize my experience and keep my information up to date.

7. IF a user provides invalid data THEN the system SHALL return specific validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage users and monitor their activities, so that I can maintain platform security and provide support.

3. WHEN an admin suspends a user THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate their sessions
4. WHEN an admin changes user role THEN the system SHALL update permissions immediately
5. WHEN an admin views user activity THEN the system SHALL show login history and actions
6. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log and alert administrators
7. IF an admin performs user management actions THEN the system SHALL audit log all changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system, I want to track user activities and maintain security logs, so that I can detect suspicious behavior and provide audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any action THEN the system SHALL log the activity with timestamp and IP
2. WHEN a user logs in from new device THEN the system SHALL record device information
3. WHEN multiple failed login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have different roles and permissions, so that I can access appropriate features based on my account type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

6. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure hashing algorithms
7. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL force password reset for affected users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive relevant notifications and manage my communication preferences, so that I stay informed without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
