# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current admin controller structure is disorganized with inconsistent patterns, mixed responsibilities, and scattered code. This refactoring will create a clean, maintainable, and consistent admin controller architecture that follows best practices and improves code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent and organized admin controller structure, so that I can easily maintain and extend admin functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing admin controllers THEN the system SHALL group related functionality into logical modules
2. WHEN implementing controllers THEN each controller SHALL follow consistent patterns for error handling, validation, and response formatting
3. WHEN structuring files THEN the system SHALL use clear naming conventions and proper separation of concerns
4. WHEN handling requests THEN all controllers SHALL use the same middleware patterns and validation approaches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized error handling and validation across all admin controllers, so that the API behavior is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN all controllers SHALL use consistent validation schemas and error handling
2. WHEN returning responses THEN all controllers SHALL use standardized response formats
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error messages and status codes
4. WHEN validating input THEN all controllers SHALL use the same validation utilities and patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly organized controller files with clear responsibilities, so that I can quickly locate and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing controllers THEN each file SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN naming files THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming patterns that reflect their purpose
3. WHEN structuring code THEN each controller SHALL separate concerns properly (validation, business logic, response handling)
4. WHEN importing dependencies THEN controllers SHALL have clean, organized import statements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent middleware usage and request handling patterns, so that all admin endpoints behave uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing endpoints THEN all SHALL use the same authentication and authorization middleware
2. WHEN handling async operations THEN all controllers SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
3. WHEN processing requests THEN all SHALL follow the same request/response lifecycle
4. WHEN logging activities THEN all admin actions SHALL be logged consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code reusability and reduced duplication, so that maintenance is easier and bugs are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing similar functionality THEN controllers SHALL reuse common utilities and helpers
2. WHEN handling validation THEN the system SHALL use shared validation schemas where appropriate
3. WHEN formatting responses THEN all controllers SHALL use the same response utilities
4. WHEN implementing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns and helpers
