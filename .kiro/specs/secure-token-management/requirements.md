# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ระบบ Secure Token Management เป็นฟีเจอร์ที่เพิ่มความปลอดภัยให้กับระบบการเข้าสู่ระบบ โดยใช้เทคนิคการเขียนโค้ดขั้นสูงเพื่อป้องกันการโจมตีแบบ cookie hijacking, token theft, XSS, CSRF และการโจมตีอื่นๆ ที่เกี่ยวข้องกับ authentication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to use secure token rotation, so that stolen tokens have minimal impact and expire quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate both access token (15 minutes expiry) and refresh token (7 days expiry)
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL allow refresh using the refresh token without requiring re-authentication
3. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL generate new access and refresh tokens and invalidate the old refresh token
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both access and refresh tokens immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want cookies to be configured with maximum security settings, so that they cannot be accessed by malicious scripts or transmitted insecurely

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL set httpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
2. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL set secure flag to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
3. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL set sameSite to 'strict' to prevent CSRF attacks
4. WHEN setting authentication cookies THEN the system SHALL set appropriate maxAge based on token type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want tokens to be bound to device characteristics, so that stolen tokens cannot be used from different devices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a token THEN the system SHALL create a device fingerprint from user-agent, screen resolution, and language settings
2. WHEN generating a token THEN the system SHALL bind the token to the client's IP address
3. WHEN validating a token THEN the system SHALL verify that the device fingerprint matches the original
4. WHEN validating a token THEN the system SHALL verify that the IP address matches or is within acceptable range
5. IF device fingerprint or IP validation fails THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to implement double submit cookie pattern, so that CSRF attacks are prevented even if cookies are compromised

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL generate a CSRF token and store it in both cookie and session
2. WHEN processing authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL require CSRF token in both cookie and request header/body
3. WHEN validating CSRF protection THEN the system SHALL verify that both tokens match exactly
4. IF CSRF tokens don't match THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 403 Forbidden status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want tokens to be encrypted before storage, so that even if storage is compromised, tokens remain protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing tokens in cookies THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN storing tokens in database THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using application-level encryption
3. WHEN retrieving tokens THEN the system SHALL decrypt them before validation
4. WHEN encryption fails THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and log the security incident

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the system to detect suspicious activities and invalidate sessions automatically, so that compromised accounts are protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token is used THEN the system SHALL check if IP address has changed significantly
2. WHEN a token is used THEN the system SHALL check if user-agent has changed
3. WHEN a token is used THEN the system SHALL check if geolocation has changed dramatically
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate all user sessions immediately
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL send security alert notification to user
6. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log the incident with full details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive security logging and monitoring, so that security incidents can be tracked and analyzed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log login attempts, successes, and failures
2. WHEN token operations occur THEN the system SHALL log token generation, refresh, and invalidation
3. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including IP, user-agent, and attempted action
4. WHEN logging security events THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, user ID, IP address, and event type
5. WHEN security logs are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they cannot be modified by application code

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want rate limiting and brute force protection, so that automated attacks are prevented

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login attempts exceed 5 failures per IP per 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL temporarily block that IP
2. WHEN login attempts exceed 3 failures per user account per 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock that account
3. WHEN implementing rate limiting THEN the system SHALL use exponential backoff for repeated violations
4. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN implementing brute force protection THEN the system SHALL require CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want secure session management with automatic cleanup, so that abandoned sessions don't pose security risks

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL set maximum session duration of 8 hours
2. WHEN sessions are idle for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically expire them
3. WHEN users have multiple active sessions THEN the system SHALL allow viewing and terminating individual sessions
4. WHEN session cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL remove all expired sessions from storage
5. WHEN concurrent session limit is reached THEN the system SHALL terminate the oldest session

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable security policies, so that security settings can be adjusted based on risk assessment

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring security policies THEN the system SHALL allow customization of token expiry times
2. WHEN configuring security policies THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of rate limiting thresholds
3. WHEN configuring security policies THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific security features
4. WHEN security policies change THEN the system SHALL apply them to new sessions immediately
5. WHEN security policies change THEN the system SHALL log the configuration changes with administrator details
